      "question": "1. Which type of pendulum is considered a more realistic representation of pendulum motion?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Double pendulum",
        "b": "Compound pendulum",
        "c": "Kater's pendulum",
        "d": "Simple pendulum"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Explanation 2",
        "b": " A compound pendulum, with its distributed mass along a rigid body, provides a more realistic representation of pendulum motion compared to a simple pendulum.",

      "question": "2. What determines the time period of a compound pendulum?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Only the mass of the pendulum",
        "b": "Only the length of the pendulum",
        "c": "The moment of inertia, mass, gravitational acceleration, and distance between the centre of mass and the pivot",
"d":"The gravitational acceleration and distance between the centre of mass and the pivot"

        "a": "Explanation 2",
        "b": "Explanation 1 <a href='www.google.com'>here</a>", 
        "c" : "The time period of a compound pendulum is determined by factors such as its moment of inertia, mass, gravitational acceleration, and the distance between the centre of mass and the pivot.",

      "question": "3. All simple pendulums are compound pendulums?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "True",
        "b": "False"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "A simple pendulum consists of a mass (called the bob) attached to a string or rod of negligible mass, swinging about a pivot point. In the case of a compound pendulum, which is a more general term, any rigid body swinging about a fixed horizontal axis can be considered. Since a simple pendulum meets these criteria (it can be thought of as a compound pendulum with a very simple, uniform mass distribution), the statement is true.",
        "b": "This explanation is incorrect because a simple pendulum can be viewed as a specific instance of a compound pendulum with a mass concentrated at a single point and a massless string or rod. Therefore, the statement that all simple pendulums are compound pendulums is true."

      "question": "4. The value of acceleration due to gravity?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "is same on equator and poles",
        "b": "is least on poles",
        "c": "is least on equator",
        "d": "increases from pole to equator"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This is incorrect because the acceleration due to gravity varies with latitude; it is not the same at the equator and the poles.",
      "b": "This is incorrect because the acceleration due to gravity is actually greatest at the poles due to the Earth's shape and rotation.",
      "c": "This is correct because the acceleration due to gravity is least at the equator due to the centrifugal force caused by the Earth's rotation and the equatorial bulge.",
      "d": "This is incorrect because the acceleration due to gravity decreases from the poles to the equator, not increases."

        "c": "Velocity",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "This is correct. The time taken by a pendulum to complete one oscillation is known as its time period. <a href='www.google.com'>here</a>",
      "b": "This is incorrect. Amplitude is the maximum extent of a vibration or oscillation, measured from the position of equilibrium.",
      "c": "This is incorrect. Velocity refers to the speed of something in a given direction.",
      "d": "This is incorrect. Frequency is the number of oscillations per unit time."
