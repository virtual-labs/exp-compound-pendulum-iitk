The procedure to determine the value of acceleration due to gravity (g) using a compound pendulum is as follows:<br>
1. Obtain a pendulum: You will need a pendulum with a bob (a weight at the end of a string) that can swing freely and a means of measuring the length of the string (or the distance from the pivot point to the center of mass of the bob).
2. Determine the length of the pendulum: Measure the length of the string from the pivot point to the center of mass of the bob. This will be the effective length of the pendulum for the purpose of this experiment.
3. Set up the pendulum: Suspend the pendulum from a rigid support such that it can swing freely. Make sure that the pendulum is at rest and the string is vertical.
4. Initiate the pendulum swing: Displace the pendulum slightly from its rest position, so that it starts to swing. Ensure that the pendulum swings in a vertical plane and that the swing is not damped.
5. Time the swing: Time the period (the time taken for one complete swing) of the pendulum using a stopwatch or a timing device. Repeat the measurement several times to obtain an average value.
6. Calculate the value of g: The value of g can be calculated using the formula:<br><br>

g = 4Ï€^2 * L / T^2
<br><br>
where L is the effective length of the pendulum and T is the period of the pendulum.<br><br>
7. Repeat the measurement: Repeat the above procedure for different lengths of pendulum and use the average value of g for the length that you are using.<br><br>
By following these steps, you can determine the value of acceleration due to gravity (g) using a compound pendulum.
