### About the Experiment 

The value of acceleration due to gravity (g) can be determined using a compound pendulum. A compound pendulum is a pendulum that consists of a rigid body, such as a metal bob, suspended from a fixed point by a cord or rod. The acceleration due to gravity can be determined by measuring the period of oscillation of the pendulum, which is the time it takes for the pendulum to complete one full swing.<br>
  
The period of a compound pendulum is given by the formula:<br>
  
  T = 2π √(L/g)<br>
  
where T is the period of oscillation, L is the length of the pendulum, and g is the acceleration due to gravity. By measuring the length of the pendulum and the period of oscillation, the value of g can be calculated.<br>
  
In a practical experiment, the length of the pendulum is measured and the time it takes for the pendulum to complete a certain number of swings is recorded. The period of oscillation is then calculated by dividing the total time by the number of swings. The value of g can then be determined using the formula above.<br><br>
